# BAT-STICK

Navigation always been a difficult & challenging time for the People with visual impairment. 
They always have to be more attentive in sensing every movement in the environment than a 
normal human being. Intermittently they are in danger which can cost their gifted life at few 
motions like while crossing the road. In many EMERGENCY situations they are unable to 
communicate instantly with their family for taking instant actions. They always feel a need to be 
accompanied by a helper but itâ€™s not affordable by majority of people
